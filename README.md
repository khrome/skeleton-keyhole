skeleton-keyhole
================
A SlippyMap WebComponent using GeoJSON, because I don't like to choose. Supports Mapbox, Leaflet, OpenLayers(ish), (soon) Google and D3(someday) .

Currently only the surfaces I use are under active development.

Sorry, super skeletal while the dust is settling. No Docs.

Roadmap
-------
[ ] finish openlayers
[ ] implement google
[ ] Events
[ ] live attributes
[ ] test harness
[ ] extended interfaces: 3D, drawing, turn-by-turn
[ ] Docs
[ ] D3

Thanks,
